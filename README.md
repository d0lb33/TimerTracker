# TimerTracker: Deprecrated

Hi, I havn't touched this in a while and will no longer be supporting it until further notice. Any code written here is more than likely speghetti and should be taken with a grain of salt. 

Thanks, 
Jonathan M. Dolbee

**Introduction**

Did you know you can type in chat "/n I made a note" and this would make a note in your league directory? Many people don't and today that will change. 

I wrote a program to read the note file in your league directory and start a timer. So what does this mean for you? Lets say you just saw Ezreal flash, just type in chat "/n ez f" and my program will start a timer at the top of your screen counting down until Ezreal's flash is back up. 

**ONLY WORKS IN BORDERLESS OR WINDOWED MODE.**

Fullscreen mode **NOT** (soon) supported!

**Auto Updater Included!**

Also, you have to say:

"f" for flash

"b" for barrier

"h" for heal

"i" for ignite

"c" for cleanse

"g" for ghost

"e" for exhaust

"t" for teleport

You can't say the whole summ spell, you must say its letter!

**Example:**

OMG ASHE JUST USED BARRIER whatever will I do to keep track of this... Oh yea **Presses enter

Thinks for a second... **Types "/n Ashe b"

**Timer starts...

Nice, <3

**End of Example**

**So why is this legal?**

My program is legal because it requires you to input when the person has flashed, it will not, AND CAN NOT automatically detect when someone has flashed. It only accesses the MyNotes.txt file in your league directory. This file is meant to be modified by its users... Its notes.
